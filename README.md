Utility for 'ThinkPad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint' (0B47189) for OSX

- Adapted from https://github.com/lentinj/tp-compact-keyboard.
- Adapted from https://github.com/unknownzerx/tpkb.

- It takes a single argument (number 1 to 9, with 1 being least sensitive and 9 being very sensitive) and adjusts the sensitivity of the TrackPoint.

It needs to be run with `sudo`.
Make sure you don't have Karabiner app launched on your machine (otherwise tpkb won't work)
